%% DESCRIPTION 
%  My feeble attempts at scripting in MATLAB. As a a useful test case I decided to go with
%  Dimitry's phake phase plate devonvolution script which you can download from his github page
%  (https://github.com/dtegunov/tom_deconv). You will also need to the tom_toolbox which is also
%  available on his github page (https://github.com/dtegunov/tom). Git clone both these tools in a single
%  folder for sanity.
%  Download this script and store in your favourite place.
%  The script is a bit dumb as I still havent figured out some things, but in its present form to make it
%  work, create a folder e.g. denconv and sym link the mrc/rec files you would like to have deconvolved in it.
%  Start matlab GUI in that directory. Then at the MATLAB cmd prompt type <run /path/to/this/script/dimitryFilter.m> without the '<','>'.
%  If all goes to plan, then Bob aught to be your Uncle, be sure to introduce him to all of us ;) :D.

%%  Set env
addpath(genpath('/path/to/dimitry's_software/on/your/local/drive'))

%% GOOIEEEE
prompt = {'Enter pixel size:','Enter approximate defocus value:'};
dlgtitle = 'Input';
dims = [1 35];
definput = {'1.327','1.75'};
answer = inputdlg(prompt,dlgtitle,dims,definput)

% Store user inputs
angpix=str2num(answer{1});
defocus=str2num(answer{2});
recs=[dir('*.mrc');dir('*.rec')];

%% Deconvolve it baby!!!
for i = 1:numel(recs)
    F=fullfile(recs(i).name);
    tag='_deconv.mrc';
    naav=strcat(F(1:end-4),tag);
    mytomo=tom_mrcread(F);
    mytomo=mytomo.Value;
    fprintf('Deconvolving tomogram %s.\n',F)
    deconv=tom_deconv(mytomo, angpix,defocus,0.8,0.8,0,false,0);
    tom_mrcwrite(deconv, 'name', naav, 'style', 'classic', 'pixelsize', angpix);
end
